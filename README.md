# OttDate

Client asking for Otto updates implemented in C/C++

It uses a slightly modified version of the fossa library.
The original fossa library is available here: https://github.com/cesanta/fossa
The hacked one here: https://github.com/kaplan2539/fossa

Commit 09fbaf93dbf8b2bcefec48382cdd0415e7458356 from the hacked repository
has been copied to this one.

TODO: clean up the hacked version of fossa and send a pull request to the original author(s).
